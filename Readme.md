- What is VillageSelector ?
***VillageSelector is a small api used to apply simple modifications to a clash of clans village file***

***For now you can only change building levels , traps , decos and some respawn variables , but more will be implemented in the future such as moving buildings (with collision detection),change troops in barracks,edit spells inside the spell factory , etc ...***

- How do i get a village file ?
***If you are a private server owner , it is the json part of player data (note: The first target of this api is the dedserver , that you can download here -> <http://cocdevforum.ml/> , but i made it compatible with villages comming from ucs server db)***
